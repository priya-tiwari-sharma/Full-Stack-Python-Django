    "1. **CharField** is used to define short-to-mid sized fixed-length strings. You must specify the max_length of the data to be stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **TextField** is used for large arbitrary-length strings. You may specify a max_length for the field, but this is used only when the field is displayed in forms (it is not enforced at the database level).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **IntegerField** is a field for storing integer (whole number) values, and for validating entered values as integers in forms.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **DateField** and **DateTimeField** are used for storing dates and date/time information These fields can additionally declare the parameters _auto_now=True_ (to set the field to the current date every time the model is saved), _auto_now_add_ (to only set the date when the model is first created) , and default (to set a default date that can be overridden by the user).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **EmailField** is used to store and validate email addresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **FileField** and **ImageField** are used to upload files and images respectively . These have parameters to define how and where the uploaded files are stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **AutoField** is a special type of IntegerField that automatically increments. A primary key of this type is automatically added to your model if you don’t explicitly specify one.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **ForeignKey** is used to specify a one-to-many relationship to another database model (e.g. a car has one manufacturer, but a manufacturer can make many cars). The \"one\" side of the relationship is the model that contains the \"key\" (models containing a \"foreign key\" referring to that \"key\", are on the \"many\" side of such a relationship).\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **ManyToManyField** is used to specify a many-to-many relationship (e.g. a book can have several genres, and each genre can contain several books).\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "4. **null** : If True, Django will store blank values as NULL in the database for fields where this is appropriate (a CharField will instead store an empty string). The default is False.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **blank** : If True, the field is allowed to be blank in your forms. The default is False, which means that Django's form validation will force you to enter a value. This is often used with null=True , because if you're going to allow blank values, you also want the database to be able to represent them appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **choices** : A group of choices for this field. If this is provided, the default corresponding form widget will be a select box with these choices instead of the standard text field.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **primary_key** : If True, sets the current field as the primary key for the model. If no field is specified as the primary key then Django will automatically add a field for this purpose.\n",
